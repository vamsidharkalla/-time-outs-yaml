When you run an agent pool job, it creates a workspace on the agent. The workspace is a directory in which it downloads the source, runs steps, and produces outputs

Build.SourcesDirectory is where tasks download the application's source code.
Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory is where tasks download artifacts needed for the pipeline or upload artifacts before they are published.
Build.BinariesDirectory is where tasks write their outputs.
Common.TestResultsDirectory is where tasks upload their test results.

The workspace clean options are applicable only for self-hosted agents. When using Microsoft-hosted agents, job are always run on a new agent.

jobs:
  - deployment: deploy
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    workspace:
      clean: all
    environment: staging
