This example YAML file publishes the artifact WebSite and then downloads the artifact to $(Pipeline.Workspace). The Deploy job only runs if the Build job is successful.

# test and upload my code as an artifact named WebSite
jobs:
- job: Build
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: npm test
  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      pathtoPublish: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
      artifactName: WebSite

# download the artifact and deploy it only if the build job succeeded
- job: Deploy
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - checkout: none #skip checking out the default repository resource
  - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
    displayName: 'Download Build Artifacts'
    inputs:
      artifactName: WebSite
      downloadPath: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)

  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()
