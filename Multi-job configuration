rom a single job you author, you can run multiple jobs on multiple agents in parallel. Some examples include:

Multi-configuration builds: You can build multiple configurations in parallel. For example, you could build a Visual C++ app for both debug and release configurations on both x86 and x64 platforms. To learn more, see Visual Studio Build - multiple configurations for multiple platforms.

Multi-configuration deployments: You can run multiple deployments in parallel, for example, to different geographic regions.

Multi-configuration testing: You can run test multiple configurations in parallel.

Multi-configuration will always generate at least one job, even if a multi-configuration variable is empty.

The matrix strategy enables a job to be dispatched multiple times, with different variable sets. The maxParallel tag restricts the amount of parallelism.
The following job will be dispatched three times with the values of Location and Browser set as specified. However, only two jobs will run at the same time.
