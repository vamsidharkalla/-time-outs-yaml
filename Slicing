An agent job can be used to run a suite of tests in parallel. For example, you can run a large suite of 1000 tests on a single agent. Or, 
you can use two agents and run 500 tests on each one in parallel.
To leverage slicing, the tasks in the job should be smart enough to understand the slice they belong to.


jobs:
- job: Test
  strategy:
    parallel: 5
